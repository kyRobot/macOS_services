# mac services

A collection of OSX Automator Workflows that can be bound to keyboard shortcuts as Services (available everywhere). Some mimic similar functions on Windows.

## How to use
1. Clone (or Download as source) the repository
2. Find the required Blah.workflow and install it by opening it (double click or select from Spotlight)
3. Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services
4. Add the required keyboard shortcut
5. Try the shortcut.

## Services
* Display Sleep - puts all connected displays to sleep immediately. With password required on wake this is similar to Windows+L
* New Finder Window - Opens or Reveals a Finder window at the User home directory i.e ~/ . This is similar to Windows+E
